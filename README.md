# Discord-PC-Control

### Control your PC remotely with a Discord bot and Python!

# Automatic Installation Instructions:

* 1: Download and install Python 3.10.5 from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3105/ (Download the "Windows installer (64-bit)")

* 2: Run the Python installer you just downloaded (Not to be confused with the installer.py file). ***Make sure the checkbox "Add Python 3.10.5 to PATH" is checked and that you install pip***

* 3: Click the green "Code" button at the top of this page, then press "Download ZIP". Extract the ZIP file to a new folder.

* 4: Open the extracted folder, and run the installer.py file. The installer I wrote will walk you through the installation from there. ***Please note, this installer downloads dependencies using PIP, and it does not install them in a virtual environment. For more control over the installation, see the [Manual Installation Guide](https://github.com/mdm9300404/Discord-PC-Control/blob/main/Manual_Install_Instructions.md))***






### If the installer.py file gives any errors, please report it to me and/or see the [Manual Installation Guide](https://github.com/mdm9300404/Discord-PC-Control/blob/main/Manual_Install_Instructions.md)
